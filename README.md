Tools & Libraries: Python, Pytorch, Numpy, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
Developed a Cat Breed Identification app using YOLOv8 for cat detection and ResNet-50 for breed classification.
Applied transfer learning with ResNet-50, fine-tuning the model on a dataset of 7,000 images to classify 20 different cat breeds. (79.5% accuracy in classifying cat breeds)
